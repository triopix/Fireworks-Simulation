Fireworks Simulation program made in processing as a final unit completion mark - credits go to Lucas Leung (mrworldwide1) for assisting with sounds and firework explosion on click. 

Tried putting stuff in organized folders, but processing couldn't read from different folders - have to figure that out later on...
